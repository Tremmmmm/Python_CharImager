			ICPR 2022 Competition on Harvesting Raw Tables 
				from Infographics (CHART-Infographics)

                PubMedCentral Training Dataset version 2.0

This package includes all annotations used for training of participant systems
of the ICPR CHART 2022 competition. Each Chart image includes Ground Truths for 
different tasks as described in the stats.txt file. 

Annotations have been provided in two formats: JSON and XML. The JSON format
is consistent with the synthetic training and testing datasets used for previous
editions of the competition. The XML format is the extended annotation used by 
our own chart annotation tools which can be used to further refine annotations. 

All Chart images are provided directly for convenience. All images are taken 
from the Open Access section of the PubMedCentral and were originally released 
under a Creative Commons license. The original publication (source) for each 
individual image can be easily identified using the image name which includes
the corresponding PMCID. 

Note that publications files in the PubMedCentral might be updated over time 
and some images might be available now at a higher resolution or with a 
different name. To avoid inconsistencies with our original annotations, we 
recommend using the versions of the images that are already provided within 
this package.
